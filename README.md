# LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
The Learning Management System (LMS) is a full-stack web application designed to simplify online education and training. Built with React (Vite) and Tailwind CSS on the frontend and Node.js, Express, and MongoDB on the backend, it enables instructors to create and manage courses while allowing students to enroll, learn, and track their progress. The platform includes secure authentication using JWT, modular content organization, real-time performance tracking, and admin controls for content moderation. It serves as a scalable solution for both academic institutions and corporate training environments.
